## How to develop

Fist you need to build app with:
```
npm run build
```

Then you can run games with:

### Game "Is number even"
```
/bin/brain-even.js
```

### Game "Calculations"
```
/bin/brain-calc.js
```

### Game "Greatest common divisor"
```
/bin/brain-gcd.js
```

### Game "Arithmetical progression"
```
/bin/brain-progression.js
```

### Game "Is number prime"
```
/bin/brain-prime.js
```

## Config

There are 3 rounds of every game by default. You can change it in `src/index.js`.
